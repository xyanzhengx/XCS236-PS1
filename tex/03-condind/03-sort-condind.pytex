Let $1,2,...,n$ denote the topological sort for a Bayesian network for the random variables 
$X_1,X_2,...,X_n$. Let $m$ be a positive integer in $\{1,2,...,n-1 \}$. Suppose, for every $i > m$, 
the random variable $X_i$ is conditionally independent of all ancestors given the previous $m$ 
ancestors in the topological ordering. Mathematically, we impose the independence assumptions

\begin{equation}\label{eq:7}
    p(X_i \mid X_{i-1},X_{i-2},...,X_{2},X_{1}) = p(X_i \mid X_{i-1},X_{i-2},...,X_{i-m})
\end{equation}

for $i > m$. For $i \le m$, we impose no conditional independence of $X_i$ with respect to its 
ancestors. Derive the total number of independent parameters to specify the joint distribution over 
$(X_1, . . . , X_n)$. You can express the answer using summation and product symbols.
