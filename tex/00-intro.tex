\textbf{Instructor's Note}

PS1 is weighted more on the written side whereas subsequent assigments will be more coding intensive. 
You will submit the entire \texttt{submission} directory. To do so run the command  below from the \texttt{src} directory
\begin{verbatim}
    zip -r submission.zip submission
\end{verbatim}

or you can choose to zip the folder up manually.

Your zipped \texttt{submission} directory should look as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{submission/\_\_init\_\_.py}
    \item \texttt{submission/sample.py}
    \item \texttt{submission/classifier.py}
    \item \texttt{submission/likelihood.py}
    \item \texttt{submission/samples.txt}
    \item \texttt{submission/random\_raw.pkl}
    \item \texttt{submission/shakespeare\_raw.pkl}
    \item \texttt{submission/neurips\_raw.pkl}
    \item \texttt{submission/classification.pkl}
    \item \texttt{submission/samples\_temperature0-95.txt}
    \item \texttt{submission/samples\_temperature0-95\_horizon2.txt} as Extra Credit
\end{enumerate}
