In this question, we will try to generate paper abstracts using the GPT-2 model. We will first implement the sampling
procedure for GPT-2. Then, we will choose 5 sentences from the abstracts of some NeurIPS\footnote{Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) is a machine learning conference.} 2015 papers and see how GPT-2 generates the 
rest of the abstract. You will need to complete the method sample in \texttt{src/submission/sample.py} in the starter code.

\textbf{Hint}: The text generated should look like a technical paper.
