We now provide new texts in \texttt{snippets.pkl}. The texts are either taken from NeurIPS 2015 papers or Shakespeareâ€™s work, 
or generated randomly. Try to infer \textbf{whether the text is random}. You will need to complete the function \texttt{classification} in 
\texttt{src/submission/classifier.py}.

\textbf{Hint}: Look carefully at the plots above in Fig. \ref{fig:ll}. Is there a simple representation space in which the 
random data is separable from the non-random data?
